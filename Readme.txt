The Voronoi Boost code is a project from the google summer code,
This project's thoughts come form the Fortune's famous paper
A Sweepline Algorithm for Voronoi Diagram

And from the site of Boost Voronoi, I come across two intresting professor
who are also intrested in the Voronoi Diagram. 
The eppstein give a page titled Geometry in Action
--Voronoi Diagrams: Application from Archaology to Zoology
In this artical the reference reading also contain a lot about the Voronoi Diagram
